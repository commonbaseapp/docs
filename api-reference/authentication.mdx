Authenticate Commonbase requests by providing your workspace API key in the
`Authorization` header.

```bash
'Authorization': '<api_key>'
```

You can generate an API Key in the `Settings` tab in the [Commonbase Dashboard](https://commonbase.com/).

### Permissions

API Keys are scoped to a single Commonbase workspace.
An API Key provides access to submit invocations for every project
inside its workspace.
