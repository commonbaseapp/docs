## Creating an Account

When you sign up for a new Commonbase account, you will be asked to create your first
`Workspace` and `Project`.

### Workspaces

A `Workspace` is like a company or an organization. Every workspace has
it's own subscription and usage caps. They can contain multiple `Projects`.

### Projects

A `Project` is like a product or a feature. PII detection, invocation monitoring,
and user logging all operate within the context of a `Project`.

To use Commonbase, you must send a `Project` ID with every request.

## Getting Started

One you have a `Project` ID, use one of our SDKs to quickly get started with Commonbase.
