## Installation

Install [Commonbase from NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Commonbase) using
a package manager or the `dotnet` CLI:

```bash
dotnet package add Commonbase
```

## Usage

A Project ID and API Key are required for all Commonbase requests. You can find
your project ID and generate an API key in the
[Commonbase Dashboard](https://commonbase.com/).

To create a completion, configure a `CommonbaseClient` with your API Key and
provide your Project ID and prompt to `CreateCompletionAsync`.

### Text Completion

To create a basic text completion, use `CreateCompletionAsync` with a `prompt`:

```csharp
using Commonbase;

CommonbaseClient client = new(apiKey: "API_KEY", projectId: "PROJECT_ID");

var completion = await client.CreateCompletionAsync(
    prompt: "Hello!"
);

Console.WriteLine(completion.BestChoice.Text);
```

`completion.BestChoice` returns the most relevant choice. `completion.Choices`
contains the fill list of choices returned by the LLM:

```csharp
foreach (var choice in completion.Choices)
{
    Console.WriteLine(choice.Text);
}
```

### Chat Completion

To create a chat completion, use `CreateChatCompletionAsync` with a list of
messages.

```csharp
using Commonbase;

CommonbaseClient client = new(apiKey: "API_KEY", projectId: "PROJECT_ID");

ChatMessage[] messages = new[] {
    new ChatMessage { Role = MessageRole.System, Content = "You help users with tech problems." },
    new ChatMessage { Role = MessageRole.User, Content = "My internet isn't working." },
    new ChatMessage { Role = MessageRole.Assistant, Content = "Have you tried restarting your router?" },
    new ChatMessage { Role = MessageRole.User, Content = "Yes I've tried that." },
};

var response = await client.CreateChatCompletionAsync(
    messages: messages
);

Console.WriteLine(response.BestChoice.Text);
```

## Streaming

To stream the completion response as it is generated, use
`StreamCompletionAsync`.

Streaming is useful when you want to display a completion "as it is typed" for a
chatbot-like experience.

For longer completions, streaming lets you avoid hanging while you wait for a
completed response from `CreateCompletionAsync`.

```csharp
using Commonbase;

CommonbaseClient client = new(apiKey: "API_KEY", projectId: "PROJECT_ID");

var stream = client.StreamCompletionAsync(
    prompt: "Write me an essay about artificial intelligence."
);

await foreach (CompletionResponse response in stream)
{
    if (!response.Completed)
        Console.Write(response.BestChoice.Text);
    else
        Console.WriteLine();
}
```
