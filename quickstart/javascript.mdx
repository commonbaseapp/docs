The Commonbase npm package is usable is all modern browsers and Node.js environments.
It also includes TypeScript support.

## Installation

Install the [Commonbase SDK package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@commonbase/sdk) using `npm`:

```
npm install @commonbase/sdk
```

## Usage

A Project ID is required for all Commonbase requests. You can find your Project ID
in the [Commonbase Dashboard](https://commonbase.com/).

### Text Completion

To create a basic text completion, use the `Client.createCompletion` method with a `prompt` argument.

```ts
import { Client } from "@commonbase/sdk";

const client = new Client();

const completion = await client.createCompletion({
  projectId: "XXXXXXXX-XXXXXXXX-XXXXXXXX-XXXXXXXX",
  prompt: "Hello",
});

console.log(completion.bestResult);
```

### Chat Completion

To create a chat completion, use the `chatContext` argument to provide a list of chat messages.
You must also set the OpenAI configuration to `chat`. In this mode, the `prompt` argument
functions as a system message.

```ts
import { Client } from "@commonbase/sdk";

const client = new Client();

const completionResult = await client.createCompletion({
  projectId: "XXXXXXXX-XXXXXXXX-XXXXXXXX-XXXXXXXX",
  prompt: "You are an assistant who helps users with tech problems.",
  chatContext: {
    messages: [
      { role: "user", content: "My internet isn't working." },
      { role: "assistant", content: "Have you tried restarting your router?" },
      { role: "user", content: "Yes I've tried that." },
    ],
  },
  providerConfig: {
    provider: "cb-openai-eu",
    params: {
      type: "chat",
    },
  },
});

console.log(completionResult.bestResult);
```

## Streaming

To receive the completion response as it is generated, use the `Client.createStreamingCompletion` method.

Streaming is useful when you want to display a completion "as it is typed" for an experience similar
to that of ChatGPT.

For longer completions, streaming also lets you avoid hanging while you wait for a completed response
from `Client.createCompletion`.

```ts
import * as process from "process";
import { Client } from "@commonbase/sdk";

const client = new Client();

const completionStream = await client.createStreamingCompletion({
  projectId: "XXXXXXXX-XXXXXXXX-XXXXXXXX-XXXXXXXX",
  prompt: "Write me a short essay about artificial intelligence.",
});

for await (const result of completionStream) {
  if (completionResult.completed) {
    process.stdout.write("\n\n");
    console.log("streamCompleted", completionResult);
    continue;
  }
  process.stdout.write(completionResult.bestResult);
}

console.log("done");
```
