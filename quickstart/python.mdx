## Installation

Install the [Commonbase package from PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/commonbase/) using `pip`:

```
pip install commonbase
```

## Usage

A Project ID is required for all Commonbase requests. You can find your Project ID
in the [Commonbase Dashboard](https://commonbase.com/).

### Text Completion

To create a basic text completion, use the `Completion.create` class method with a `prompt` argument.

```py
import commonbase

project_id="XXXXXXXX-XXXXXXXX-XXXXXXXX-XXXXXXXX"

result = commonbase.Completion.create(project_id=project_id, prompt="Hello!")

print(result.choices[0].text)
```

### Chat Completion

To create a chat completion, use the `chat_context` argument to provide a list of chat messages.
You must also set the OpenAI configuration to `chat`. In this mode, the `prompt` argument
functions as a system message.

```py
import commonbase

project_id="XXXXXXXX-XXXXXXXX-XXXXXXXX-XXXXXXXX"

result = commonbase.Completion.create(
    project_id=project_id,
    prompt="You are an assistant who helps users with tech problems.",
    chat_context=commonbase.ChatContext([
        commonbase.ChatMessage(role="user", content="My internet isn't working."),
        commonbase.ChatMessage(role="assistant", content="Have you tried restarting your router?"),
        commonbase.ChatMessage(role="user", content="Yes I've tried that."),
    ]),
    provider_config=commonbase.ProviderConfig(
        provider="cb-openai-eu", params=commonbase.OpenAIParams(type="chat")
    ),
)

print(result.choices[0].text)
```

## Streaming

To receive the completion response as it is generated, use the `Completion.stream` class method.

Streaming is useful when you want to display a completion "as it is typed" for an experience similar
to that of ChatGPT.

For longer completions, streaming also lets you avoid hanging while you wait for a completed response
from `Completion.create`.

```py
import commonbase

project_id="XXXXXXXX-XXXXXXXX-XXXXXXXX-XXXXXXXX"

result = commonbase.Completion.stream(
    project_id=project_id,
    prompt="Write me a short essay about artificial intelligence."
)

for completion in result:
    print(completion.choices[0].text, end="")
```
