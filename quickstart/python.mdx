## Installation

Install [Commonbase from PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/commonbase/) using
`pip`:

```bash
pip install commonbase
```

## Usage

A Project ID and API Key are required for all Commonbase requests. You can find
your project ID and generate an API key in the
[Commonbase Dashboard](https://commonbase.com/).

To create a completion, provide your Project ID, API Key, and prompt to
`Completion.create`.

### Text Completion

To create a basic text completion, use `Completion.create` with a `prompt`:

```py
import commonbase

completion = commonbase.Completion.create(
    api_key="API_KEY",
    project_id="PROJECT_ID",
    prompt="Hello!"
)

print(completion.best_result)
```

`completion.best_result` returns the most relevant choice. `completion.choices`
contains the full list of choices returned by the LLM:

```py
for choice in completion.choices:
    print(choice.text)
```

### Chat Completion

To create a chat completion, provide a `chat_context` with list of chat messages
and set the `provider_config.params.type` to `'chat'`. In this mode, the
`prompt` is prepended to the context as a system message.

```py
import commonbase

completion = commonbase.Completion.create(
    api_key="API_KEY",
    project_id="PROJECT_ID",
    prompt="You are an assistant who helps users with tech problems.",
    chat_context=commonbase.ChatContext([
        commonbase.ChatMessage(role="user", content="My internet isn't working."),
        commonbase.ChatMessage(role="assistant", content="Have you tried restarting your router?"),
        commonbase.ChatMessage(role="user", content="Yes I've tried that."),
    ]),
    provider_config=commonbase.ProviderConfig(
        provider="cb-openai-eu", params=commonbase.OpenAIParams(type="chat")
    ),
)

print(completion.best_result)
```

### Variables

You can also create a completion by providing variables and a template prompt.

```py
import commonbase

completion = commonbase.Completion.create(
    api_key="API_KEY",
    project_id="PROJECT_ID",
    prompt="A new user {{user_name}} just signed up with {{email}}. Say hello!"
    variables={
        "user_name": "Alice",
        "email": "alice@example.com"
    }
)

print(completion.best_result)
```

## Streaming

To stream the completion response as it is generated, use `Completion.stream`.

Streaming is useful when you want to display a completion "as it is typed" for a
chatbot-like experience.

For longer completions, streaming lets you avoid hanging while you wait for a
completed response from `Completion.create`.

```py
import commonbase

completionStream = commonbase.Completion.stream(
    api_key="API_KEY",
    project_id="PROJECT_ID",
    prompt="Write me a short essay about artificial intelligence."
)

for completion in completionStream:
    if not completion.completed:
        print(completion.choices[0].text, end="")
    else:
        print("\n\ndone")
```
